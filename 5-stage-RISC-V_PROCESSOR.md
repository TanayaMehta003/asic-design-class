### Makerchip and TL-Verilog introduction:

Makerchip utilizes the Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog) standard, which marks a major improvement by eliminating the need for outdated features of traditional Verilog and introducing a more concise syntax.
TL-Verilog boosts design productivity by incorporating robust constructs for pipelines and transactions, simplifying the development of complex digital circuits.
